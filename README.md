# DigiQSpringSchoolQST24
This is the repository where students can find the necessary documents for the workshop on Quantum Safe Cryptography.
## Content
1. **guide_springSchool_OpenSourceToolsQST.pdf** : Document containing several sections. In each of these, we explain how to access to currently available open-source tools to test quantum-safe algorithms in different contexts.
2. **ecdsap256p521_kyber1024_ONLINE_OQS.pcap** and **p384_sphincssha2192fsimplep384_frodo976aes_ONLINE_OQS.pcap**: These are two network captures. A PCAP (Packet CAPture) file is a file format used to store network traffic captured by network sniffers like Wireshark, tcpdump, and various other networking tools. The PCAP file format is designed to save all the information about the network traffic at the time it was captured, including the data packets themselves and metadata about each packet, such as timestamps, network protocols used, packet size, and more. In each of these files different algorithms were used, and the students will be able to compare them with the given tools.
